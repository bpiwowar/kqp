title: Kernel Quantum Probability (KQP) library
---
h1. Welcome to the Kernel Quantum Probability (KQP) library

This project aims at providing an API that allows to compute quantum densities (semi-definite positive hermitian operators) or events (subspaces). 
It provides tools to compute quantum probabilities and update densities (conditionalisation), and supports the use of kernels to implicitly define the space, thus allowing working in very high dimensional spaces.

If you use KQP, please cite the *"associated technical report":http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6005*

Features
* L-GPL license
* Wrappers in Java and Python (planned)
* Various methods to compute a symmetric kernel EVD, i.e. $$\sum_i \alpha_i \varphi_i \varphi_i^\dagger $$ where \(\varphi_i\) lies in an (implicit) feature space 
* Quantum probabilities: 
** computation,
** conditionalisation,
** "entropy":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_quantum_entropy,
** and "divergence":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_relative_entropy.
* Other modules:
** Cone Quadratic Optimization (translated from python from "cvxopt":http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/),
** Pre-image removal, 
** rank-one fast EVD update
