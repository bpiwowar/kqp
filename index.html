Welcome to the KQP homepage.

This project is an API for computing so-called "quantum probabilities", i.e. probabilities arising from the quantum physics generalisation of probability theory.
In particular, this project aims at computing all the necessary quantities using kernels, thus allowing to work in very high dimensional spaces.
